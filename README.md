## Introduction
Hello, we are project group 15 for ITCS 3160. We are Edward Krizhevskiy, Saleh Saleh, Saad Mahmoud El Refai, and Rachel Conforti. <br>
We will be using a pre-exisitng database made by graduate UNCC students, which called themselves the "mavericks" and consisted of 
Dhananjay Arora, Akshay Babu, Sumit Kawale, and Prashant Madaan. <br>
This database is for a campus food delivery service for college campuses. This service allows the college to control who is coming on and off of campus for food delivery for health and safety reasons.What we will be adding is a rating
system that will allow customers to rate their driver and the resturant. Customers will be able to see what other students have rated resturants and will also allow administrators to view these ratings.  

## Use Case for Rating System

## Business Rules:
A Driver can have zero to many ratings.<br>
A Driver Rating can only be about one specific driver.<br>
A Restaurant can have zero to many ratings.<br>
A Restaurant Rating can only be about one specific Restaurant.<br>
